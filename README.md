### Events Website with Email Sign-in.

A small full-stack project aimed at enhancing our understanding of Next.js, following an educational course by [Alicia Rodriguez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjY94sAKLlw&t=16054s)

In this project, we learned about Server-Side Rendering, explored Next.js file structure, and delved into data fetching. Additionally, we applied CSS styles using SASS. Finally, we tackled API routing in Next.js and deployed the project with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
